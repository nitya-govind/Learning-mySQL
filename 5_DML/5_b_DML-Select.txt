*** WILDCARD characters - %, _, *

1.	mysql>	SELECT column1, column2 FROM tableName
1.a. For all columns in a table:
	mysql>	SELECT * FROM tableName
1.b. 	mysql>	SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2 FROM tableName


2.	mysql>	SELECT column1, column2 FROM tableName WHERE condition
2.a.	Conditions:
	=
	AND OR (AND has higher precedence over OR, if you want otherwise, use brackets)
	IN, NOT IN(used instead of using OR..OR..OR and is faster than multiple Ors)
	LIKE, NOT LIKE (regex: % for multiple match, _ for single match)
	BETWEEN ... AND ..., NOT BETWEEN... AND ...
	IS NULL, IS NOT NULL
	AGGREGATES: = < > <= >= != or <>

2.b.	HAVING
	Same as WHERE but 2 differences
	1. WHERE cannot use an aggregate function, HAVING can
	2. HAVING has to be sandwiched between GROUP BY and ORDER BY
	3. HAVING block cannot have a non-aggregate (example: <) and aggregate

2.c.	Aggregate functions
	COUNT(), COUNT(DISTINCT), SUM(), AVG(), etc.
	GROUP BY, ORDER BY	
	AS (aliasing for readability)
	LIMIT


*** General order:
		SELECT something
		FROM something
		WHERE some condition
		GROUP BY something
		HAVING
		ORDER BY something
